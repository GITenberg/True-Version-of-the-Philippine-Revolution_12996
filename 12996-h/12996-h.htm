<p id="d0e75">I dedicate to you this modest work with a view to informing you respecting the international events which have occurred during
the past three years and are still going on in the Philippines, in order that you may be fully acquainted with the facts and
be thereby placed in a position to pronounce judgment upon the issue and be satisfied and assured of the Justice which forms
the basis and is in fact the foundation of our Cause. I place the simple truth respectfully before and dedicate it to you
as an act of homage and as testimony of my admiration for and recognition of the wide knowledge, the brilliant achievements
and the great power of other nations, whom I salute, in the name the Philippine nation, with every effusion of my soul.

<p id="d0e77"><span class="smallcaps">The Author.</span>

</p><span class="pageno"><a id="d0e81"></a>Page 1</span><a id="d0e84"></a><h1>The Revolution of 1896</h1>
<p id="d0e87">Spain maintained control of the Philippine Islands for more than three centuries and a half, during which period the tyranny,
misconduct and abuses of the Friars and the Civil and Military Administration exhausted the patience of the natives and caused
them to make a desperate effort to shake off the unbearable galling yoke on the 26th and 31st August, 1896, then commencing
the revolution in the provinces of Manila and Cavite.

</p>
<p id="d0e89">On these memorable days the people of Balintawak, Santa Mesa, Kalookan, Kawit, Noveleta and San Francisco de Malabon rose
against the Spaniards and proclaimed the Independence of the Philippines, and in the course of the next five days these uprisings
were followed by the inhabitants of the other towns in Cavite province joining in the revolt against the Spanish Government
although there was no previous arrangement looking to a general revolt. The latter were undoubtedly moved to action by the
noble example of the former.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e91"></a>Page 2</span></p>
<p id="d0e92">With regard to the rising in the province of Cavite it should be stated that although a call to arms bearing the signatures
of Don Augustin Rieta, Don Candido Firona and myself, who were Lieutenants of the Revolutionary Forces, was circulated there
was no certainty about the orders being obeyed, or even received by the people, for it happened that one copy of the orders
fell into the hands of a Spaniard named Don Fernando Parga, Military Governor of the province, who at that time was exercising
the functions of Civil Governor, who promptly reported its contents to the Captain-General of the Philippines, Don Ramon Blanco
y Erenas. The latter at once issued orders for the Spanish troops to attack the revolutionary forces.

</p>
<p id="d0e94">It would appear beyond doubt that One whom eye of man hath not seen in his wisdom and mercy ordained that the emancipation
of the oppressed people of the Philippines should be undertaken at this time, for otherwise it is inexplicable how men armed
only with sticks and <i>gulok</i><a id="d0e98src" href="#d0e98" class="noteref">1</a> wholly unorganized and undisciplined, could defeat the Spanish Regulars in severe engagements at Bakoor, Imus and Noveleta
and, in addition to making many of them prisoners, captured a large quantity of arms and ammunition. It was owing to this
astonishing success of the revolutionary troops that General Blanco quickly concluded to endeavour, to maintain Spanish control
by the adoption of a <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e104"></a>Page 3</span>conciliatory policy under the pretext that thereby he could quel the rebellion, his first act being a declaration to the effect
that it was not the purpose of his Government to oppress the people and he had no desire &#8220;to slaughter the Filipinos.&#8221;.

</p>
<p id="d0e106">The Government of Madrid disapproved of General Blanco's new policy and speedily appointed Lieutenant-General Don Camilo Polavieja
to supersede him, and despatched forthwith a large number of Regulars to the Philippines.

</p>
<p id="d0e108">General Polavieja advanced against the revolutionary forces with 16,000 men armed with Mausers, and one field battery. He
had scarcely reconquered half of Cavite province when he resigned, owing to bad health. That was in April, 1897.

</p>
<p id="d0e110">Polavieja was succeeded by the veteran General Don Fernando Primo de Rivera, who had seen much active service. As soon as
Rivera had taken over command of the Forces he personally led his army in the assault upon and pursuit of the revolutionary
forces, and so firmly, as well as humanely, was the campaign conducted that he soon reconquered the whole of Cavite province
and drove the insurgents into the mountains.

</p>
<p id="d0e112">Then I established my headquarters in the wild and unexplored mountain fastness of Biak-na-bat&oacute;, where I formed the Republican
Government of the Philippines at the end of May, 1897.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e114"></a>Page 4</span></p>

</p>
</div><a id="d0e115"></a><h1>The Treaty of Biak-na-bat&oacute;</h1>
<p id="d0e118">Don Pedro Alejandro Paterno (who was appointed by the Spanish Governor-General sole mediator in the discussion of the terms
of peace) visited Biak-na-bat&oacute; several times to negotiate terms of the Treaty, which, after negotiations extending over five
months, and careful consideration had been given to each clause, was finally completed and signed on the 14th December, 1897,
the following being the principal conditions:&#8212;

</p>
<p id="d0e120">(1) That I would, and any of my associates who desired to go with me, be free to live in any foreign country. Having fixed
upon Hongkong as my place of residence, it was agreed that payment of the indemnity of $800,000 (Mexican) should be made in
three installments, namely, $400,000 when all the arms in Biak-na-bat&oacute; were delivered to the Spanish authorities; $200,000
when the arms surrendered amounted to eight hundred stand; the final payment to be made when one thousand stand of arms shall
have been handed over to the authorities and the <i>Te Deum</i> sung in the Cathedral in Manila as thanksgiving for the restoration of peace. The latter part of February was fixed as the
limit of time wherein the surrender of arms should be completed.

</p>
<p id="d0e125">(2) The whole of the money was to be paid to me personally, leaving the disposal of the money to my discretion and knowledge
of the <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e127"></a>Page 5</span>understanding with my associates and other insurgents.

</p>
<p id="d0e129">(3) Prior to evacuating Biak-na-bat&oacute; the remainder of the insurgent forces under Captain-General Primo de Rivera should send
to Biak-na-bat&oacute; two General of the Spanish Army to be held as hostages by my associates who remained there until I and a few
of my compatriots arrived in Hongkong and the first installment of the money payment (namely, four hundred thousand dollars)
was paid to me.

</p>
<p id="d0e131">(4) It was also agreed that the religious corporations in the Philippines be expelled and an autonomous system of government,
political and administrative, be established, though by special request of General Primo de Rivera these conditions were not
insisted on in the drawing up of the Treaty, the General contending that such concessions would subject the Spanish Government
to severe criticism and even ridicule.

</p>
<p id="d0e133">General Primo de Rivera paid the first installment of $400,000 while the two Generals were hold as hostages in Biak-na-bat&oacute;.

</p>
<p id="d0e135">We, the revolutionaries, discharged our obligation to surrender our arms, which were over 1,000 stand, as everybody knows,
it having been published in the Manila newspapers. But the Captain General Primo de Rivera failed to fulfill the agreement
as faithfully as we did. The other installments were never paid; the Friars were neither restricted in their acts of tyranny
and <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e137"></a>Page 6</span>oppression nor were any steps taken to expel them or secularize the religious Orders; the reforms demanded were not inaugurated,
though the <i>Te Deum</i> was sung. This failure of the Spanish authorities to abide by the terms of the Treaty caused me and my companions much unhappiness,
which quickly changed to exasperation when I received a letter from Lieutenant-Colonel Don Miguel Primo de Rivera (nephew
and private Secretary of the above-named General) informing me that I and my companions could never return to Manila.

</p>
<p id="d0e142">Was the procedure of this special representative of Spain just?

</p><a id="d0e144"></a><h1>Negotiations</h1>
<p id="d0e147">But I and my companions were not to be kept long in our distress, grieving over the bad faith of the Spaniards, for in the
month of March of the year referred to (1898) some people came to me and in the name of the Commander of the U.S.S. <i>Petrel</i> asked for a conference in compliance with the wishes of Admiral Dewey.

</p>
<p id="d0e152">I had some interviews with the above-mentioned Commander, <i>i.e.</i>, during the evening of the 16th March and 6th April, during which the Commander urged me to return to the Philippines to
renew hostilities against the Spaniards with the object of gaining our independence, and he assured me of the assistance of
the United States in the event of war between the United States and Spain.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e157"></a>Page 7</span></p>
<p id="d0e158">I then asked the Commander of the <i>Petrel</i> what the United States could concede to the Filipinos. In reply he said: &#8220;<i>The United States is a great and rich nation and needs no colonies</i>.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e166">In view of this reply I suggested to the Commander the advisability of stating in writing what would be agreed to by the United
States, and be replied that he would refer the matter to Admiral Dewey.

</p>
<p id="d0e168">In the midst of my negotiations with the Commander of the <i>Petrel</i> I was interrupted by letters from Isabelo Artacho and his solicitors, on the 5th April, claiming $200,000 of the money received
from the Spanish authorities, and asserting that he (Artacho) should receive this sum as salary due to him while acting as
Secretary of the Interior, he having been, it was alleged, a member of the Filipino Government established in Biak-na-bat&oacute;.
These letters contained the threat that failure to comply with the demand of Artacho would result in him bringing me before
the Courts of Law in Hongkong. It may make the matter clearer if I mention at this point that Isabelo Artacho arrived at Biak-na-bat&oacute;
and made himself known to and mixed with the officers in the revolutionary camp on the 21st day of September, 1897, and was
appointed Secretary of the Interior in the early part of November of that year, when the Treaty of Peace proposed and negotiated
by Don Pedro Alejandro Paterno was almost concluded, as is proved by the fact that the document was signed on the 14th of
December of that year.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e173"></a>Page 8</span></p>
<p id="d0e174">In the light of these facts the unjust and unreasonable nature of the claim of Artacho is easily discernable, for it is monstrous
to claim $200,000 for services rendered to the Revolutionary Government during such a brief period.

</p>
<p id="d0e176">Moreover, it is a fact that it was agreed between ourselves (the leaders of the Revolution assembled in Biak-na-bat&oacute;) that
in the event of the Spaniards failing to comply with each and every one of the terms and conditions of the Agreement the money
obtained from the Spanish Government should not be divided, but must be employed in the purchase of arms and ammunition to
renew the war of independence.

</p>
<p id="d0e178">It is therefore evident that Artacho, in making this preposterous demand, was acting as a spy for the enemy, as an agent of
General Primo de Rivera, for he wanted to extinguish the rebellion by depriving its organizers and leaders of the most indispensable
element, the &#8220;sinews of war,&#8221; which is money. This was the view, too, of the whole of my colleagues, and it was resolved by
us that I should leave Hongkong immediately and thereby avoid the litigation which Artacho seemed bent upon and thereby afford
my companions time and opportunity to remove this new and wholly unexpected barrier to the realization of our cherished plans
for the emancipation of our beloved fatherland. I am profoundly pleased to say that they succeeded, Artacho withdrawing the
suit through a transaction.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e180"></a>Page 9</span></p>
<p id="d0e181">In accordance with the decision of the meeting above referred to, I left Hongkong quietly on the 7th April, 1898, on board
the steamship <i>Taisany</i>, and after calling at Saigon I reached Singapore as a passenger by the s.s. <i>Eridan</i>, landing there as secretly as possible on the 21st April. I at once proceeded to the residence of one of my countrymen.

</p>
<p id="d0e189">Thus is explained the cause of the interruption of the vitally important negotiations with Admiral Dewey, initiated by the
Commander of the <i>Petrel</i>.

</p>
<p id="d0e194">But &#8220;Man proposes and God disposes&#8221; is a proverb which was verified in its fullest sense on this occasion, for, notwithstanding
the precautions taken in my journey to avoid identification yet at 4 o'clock in the afternoon of the day I arrived at Singapore
an Englishman came to the house in which I was residing and in a cautious manner stated that the United States Consul at that
port, Mr. Spencer Pratt, wished to have an interview with Don Emilio Aguinaldo. The visitor was told that in that house they
did not know Aguinaldo; this being the prearranged answer for any callers.

</p>
<p id="d0e196">But the Englishman returned to the house several times and persisted in saying that it was no use trying to conceal the fact
of Aguinaldo's arrival for Consul Pratt had received notice from Admiral Dewey of General Aguinaldo's journey to Singapore.

<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e198"></a>Page 10</span></p>
<p id="d0e199">In reply, the Consul said he would telegraph about this matter to Admiral Dewey, who was, he said, Commander-in-Chief of the
squadron which would invade the Philippines, and who had, he also stated, full powers conferred on him by President McKinley.

</p>
<p id="d0e201">Between 10 or 12 in the forenoon of the next day the conference was renewed and Mr. Pratt then informed me that the Admiral
had sent him a telegram in reply to the wish I had expressed for an agreement in writing. He said the Admiral's reply was&#8212;<i>That the United States would at least recognize the Independence of the Philippines under the protection of the United States
Navy. The Consul added that there was no necessity for entering into a formal written agreement because the word of the Admiral
and of the United States Consul were in fact equivalent to the most solemn pledge that their verbal promises and assurance
would be fulfilled to the letter and were not to be classed with Spanish promises or Spanish ideas of a man's word of honour.
In conclusion the Consul said, &#8220;The Government of North America, is a very honest, just, and powerful government.</i>&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e206">Being informed of what had been said by the visitor I consented to meet Consul Pratt, and had a strictly private interview
with him between 9 and 12 p.m. on 22nd April, 1898, in one of the suburbs of Singapore. As soon as Mr. Pratt met me he said
that war had been formally declared by the United States against Spain the day before, <i>i.e.</i>, on the 21st April.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e211"></a>Page 11</span></p>
<p id="d0e212">In the course of the interview alluded to, Consul Pratt told me that as the Spaniards had not fulfilled the promises made
in the Biak-na-bat&oacute; Agreement, the Filipinos had the right to continue the revolution which had been checked by the Biak-na-bat&oacute;
arrangement, and after urging me to resume hostilities against the Spaniards he assured me that the United States would grant
much greater liberty and more material benefits to the Filipinos than the Spaniards ever promised.

</p>
<p id="d0e214">I then asked the Consul what benefits the United States would confer on the Philippines, pointing out at the same time the
advisability of making an agreement and setting out all the terms and conditions in black and white.

</p>
<p id="d0e216">Being as anxious to be in the Philippines as Admiral Dewey and the North American Consul&#8212;to renew the struggle for our Independence&#8212;I
took the opportunity afforded me by these representatives of the United States, and, placing the fullest confidence in their
word of honour, I said to Mr. Pratt (in response to his persistent professions of solicitude for the welfare of my countrymen)
that he could count upon me when I returned to the Philippines to raise the people as one man against the Spaniards, with
the one grand object in view as above mentioned, if I could take firearms with me to distribute amongst my countrymen. I assured
him that I would put forth my utmost endeavours to crush and extinguish the power of Spain in the islands and I added that
if in possession of one <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e218"></a>Page 12</span>battery of a dozen field-guns I would make the Spaniards surrender Manila in about two weeks.

</p>
<p id="d0e220">The Consul said he would help me to get over to the Philippines the consignment of arms in respect of which I had made the
preliminary arrangements in Hongkong, and he added that he would at once telegraph to Admiral Dewey informing him of this
promise in order that the Admiral might give what assistance laid in his power to make the expedition in question a success.

</p>
<p id="d0e222">On the 25th April the last conference was held in the United States Consulate at Singapore. I was invited by the Consul to
meet him on this occasion and as soon as we met he said he had received a telegram from the Admiral requesting him to ask
me to proceed to Hongkong by first steamer to join the Admiral who was then with his squadron in Mir's Bay; a Chinese harbour
close to Hongkong. I replied to this proposal in the affirmative, and gave directions to my <i>aide-de-camp</i> to at once procure passages for myself and companions, care being taken that the tickets should bear the assumed names we
had adopted on the occasion of our journey from Hongkong to Singapore, it being advisable that we should continue to travel
<i>incognito</i>.

</p>
<p id="d0e230">On the 26th April I called on Consul Pratt to bid him adieu on the eve of my departure from Singapore by the steamship <i>Malacca</i>. The Consul, after telling me that when I got near the port of Hongkong I would be met by the Admiral's launch <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e235"></a>Page 13</span>and taken from the <i>Malacca</i> to the American squadron (a precaution against news of my movements becoming public property, of which I highly approved),
then asked me to appoint him Representative of the Philippines in the United States, there to zealously advocate official
recognition of our Independence. My answer was, that I would propose him for the position of Representative of the Philippines
in the United States when the Philippine Government was properly organized, though I thought it an insignificant reward for
his assistance, for, in the event of our Independence becoming <i>un fait accompli</i> I intended to offer him a high position in the Customs Department, besides granting certain commercial advantages and contributing
towards the cost of the war whatever sum he might consider due to his Government; because the Filipinos had already decided
such a policy was the natural outcome of the exigencies of the situation and could be construed only as a right and proper
token of the nation's gratitude.

</p>
<p id="d0e243">But to continue the statement of facts respecting my return to Hongkong from Singapore: I left Singapore with my A.D. Cs.,
Sres Pilar and Leyba, bound for Hongkong by the s.s. <i>Malacca</i>, arriving at Hongkong at 2 a.m. on the 1st May, without seeing or hearing anything of the launch which I had been led by
Consul Pratt to expect to meet me near the entrance of Hongkong harbour. In response to an invitation from Mr. Rounsevelle
Wildman, United States Consul at Hongkong, I wended my way to the United States Consulate and between 9 and 11 p.m. <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e248"></a>Page 14</span>of the same day I had an interview with him. Mr. Wildman told me that Admiral Dewey left for Manila hurriedly in accordance
with imperative orders from his Government directing him to attack the Spanish Fleet. He was therefore unable to await my
arrival before weighing anchor and going forth to give battle to the Spaniards. Mr. Wildman added that Admiral Dewey left
word with him that he would send a gunboat to take me across to the Philippines. In the course of this interview with Mr.
Wildman I spoke to him about the shipment of arms to the islands which I had previously planned with him, and it was then
agreed among ourselves that he (Mr. Rounsevelle Wildman) and the Filipino Mr. Teodoro Sandico should complete the arrangements
for the despatch of the expedition, and I there and then handed to and deposited with them the sum of $50,000.

</p>
<p id="d0e250">A steam launch was quickly purchased for $15,000, while a contract was made and entered into for the purchase of 2,000 rifles
at $7 each and 200,000 rounds of ammunition at $33 and 56/100 per 1000.

</p>
<p id="d0e252">A week later (7th May) the American despatch-boat <i>McCulloch</i> arrived from Manila bringing news of Admiral Dewey's victory over the Spanish fleet, but did not bring orders to convey me
to Manila. At 9 o'clock that night I had another interview with Consul Wildman, at his request.

</p>
<p id="d0e257">On the 15th of the same month the <i>McCulloch</i> again arrived at Hongkong from Manila, this time <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e262"></a>Page 15</span>bringing orders to convey me and my companions to Manila. I was promptly notified of this by Consul Wildman who requested
that we go on board the <i>McCulloch</i> at 10 o'clock at night on 16th May. Accompanied by Consul Wildman, the Captain of the <i>McCulloch</i>, and Mr. John Barrett (who then usually styled himself &#8220;ex-Secretary of the United States Legation in Siam&#8221;) we boarded an
American steam launch and proceeded to Chinese Kowloon Bay, where the <i>McCulloch</i> was anchored. While bidding us adieu Mr. Barrett said he would call on me in the Philippines, which he did later on in Cavite
and Malolos.

</p>
<p id="d0e273">Mr. Wildman strongly advised me to establish a Dictatorship as soon as I arrived in the Philippines, and he assured me that
he would use his best endeavours to have the arms already contracted for delivered to me in the Philippines, which he in fact
did. [It is to be observed, though, that the first expedition having been conducted satisfactorily, the arms reaching me in
due course, I was naturally grateful and had confidence in the sincerity and good faith of Consul Wildman, and there was nothing
surprising therefore in the fact that I asked him to fit out another expedition and caused the sum of $67,000 to be deposited
with him for that purpose. I regret to state, however, that Mr. Wildman has failed to comply with my request and I am informed
that he refuses to refund the money.]

</p>
<p id="d0e275">The <i>McCulloch</i> left Hongkong at 11 a.m. on the 17th May and arrived off Cavite (Manila Bay) <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e280"></a>Page 16</span>between noon and 1 p.m. on the 19th idem. No sooner had the <i>McCulloch</i> dropped anchor than the Admiral's launch, carrying his Adjutant and Private Secretary, came alongside to convey me the flagship
<i>Olympia</i>, where I was received with my Adjutant (Sr. Leyba) with the honours due to a General.

</p>
<p id="d0e288">The Admiral ushered me into his private quarters, and after the exchange of the usual greetings I asked <i>whether it was true that he had sent all the telegrams to the Consul at Singapore, Mr. Pratt, which that gentleman had told
me he received in regard to myself. The Admiral replied in the affirmative, adding that the United States had come to the
Philippines to protect the natives and free them from the yoke of Spain. He said, moreover, that America is exceedingly well
off as regards territory, revenue, and resources and therefore needs no colonies</i>, assuring me finally that <i>there was no occasion for me to entertain any doubts whatever about the recognition of the Independence of the Philippines
by the United States</i>. Then Admiral Dewey asked me if I could induce the people to rise against the Spaniards and make a short, sharp, and decisive
campaign of it.

</p>
<p id="d0e296">I said in reply that events would speak for themselves, but while a certain arms expedition (respecting which Consul Wildman
was duly informed that it would be despatched from a Chinese port) was delayed in China we could do nothing, because without
arms every victory would assuredly cost us the lives of many brave and dashing <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e298"></a>Page 17</span>Filipino warriors. The Admiral thereupon offered to despatch a steamer to hurry up the expedition. (This, be it borne in mind,
in addition to the General orders he had given the Consul to assist us to procure arms and ammunition.) Then he at once placed
at my disposal all the guns seized onboard the Spanish warships as well as 62 Mausers and a good many rounds of ammunition
which had been brought up from Corregidor Island by the U.S.S. <i>Petrel</i>.

</p>
<p id="d0e303">I then availed myself of an early opportunity to express to the Admiral my deep gratitude for the assistance rendered to the
people of the Philippines by the United States, as well as my unbounded admiration of the grandeur and beneficence of the
American people. I also candidly informed the Admiral that before I left Hongkong the Filipinos residing in that colony hold
a meeting at which the following question was fully discussed, namely, <i>the possibility that after the Spaniards were defeated, and their power and prestige in the islands destroyed, the Filipinos
might have to wage war against the United States owing to the American Government declining to recognize our independence.
In that event the Americans, it was generally agreed, would be sure to defeat us for they would find us worn out and short
of ammunition owing to our struggle with the Spaniards. I concluded by asking the gallant Admiral to excuse me for an amount
of frankness that night appear to border on impudence, and assured him of the fact that I was actuated only by a desire to
have a perfectly clear understanding in the interest of both parties.</i>
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e308"></a>Page 18</span></p>
<p id="d0e309"><i>The Admiral said he was very glad to have this evidence of our earnestness and straightforwardness and he thought the Filipinos
and Americans should act towards one another as friends and allies, and therefore it was right and proper that all doubts
should be expressed frankly in order that explanations be made, difficulties avoided, and distrust removed; adding that, as
he had already indicated</i>, <span class="smallcaps">the United States would unquestionably recognize the Independence of the people of the Philippines, guaranteed as it was by
the word of honour of Americans</span>, <i>which, he said, is more positive, more irrevocable than any written agreement, which might not be regarded as binding when
there is an intention or desire to repudiate it, as was the case in respect of the compact made with the Spaniards at Biak-na-bat&oacute;.
Then the Admiral advised me to at once have made a Filipino National Flag, which he said he would recognize and protect in
the presence of the other nations represented by the various squadrons anchored in Manila Bay, adding, however, that he thought
it advisable that we should destroy the power of Spain before hoisting our national flag, in order that the act would appear
more important and creditable in the eyes of the world and of the United States in particular. Then when the Filipino vessels
passed to and fro with the national flag fluttering in the breeze they would attract more attention and be more likely to
induce respect for the national colours</i>.

</p>
<p id="d0e319">I again thanked the Admiral for his good advice and generous offers, giving him to understand clearly that I was willing to
sacrifice my <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e321"></a>Page 19</span>own life if he would be thereby more exalted in the estimation of the United States, more honoured by his fellow-countrymen.

</p>
<p id="d0e323">I added that under the present conditions of hearty co-operation, good fellowship and a clear understanding the whole nation
would respond to the call to arms to shake off the yoke of Spain and obtain their freedom by destroying the power of Spain
in all parts of the archipelago. If, however, all did not at once join in the movement that should not cause surprise, for
there would be many unable to assist owing to lack of arms and ammunition, while others, again, might be reluctant to take
an active part in the campaign on account of the loss and inconvenience to themselves and families that would result, from
open hostility to the Spaniards.

</p>
<p id="d0e325">Thus ended my first interview with Admiral Dewey, to whom I signified my intention to reside for a while at the headquarters
of the Naval Commandant of Cavite Arsenal.

</p><a id="d0e327"></a><h1>The Revolution of 1898</h1>
<p id="d0e330">I returned to the <i>McCulloch</i> to give directions for the landing of the luggage and <i>war materials</i> which I brought over with me from Hongkong. On my way to the <i>McCulloch</i> I met several of my old associates in the 1896 revolution who had come over from Bataan province. To these friends I gave
two letters directing the people of that <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e341"></a>Page 20</span>province and Zambales to rise against the Spaniards and vigorously attack them.

</p>
<p id="d0e343">Before returning to the Arsenal and when near the landing place I came across several <i>bancas</i> [large open boats] loaded with revolutionists of Kawit (my birth-place) who told me they had been looking out for me for
about two weeks, the Americans having announced that I would soon return to the islands. The feeling of joy which I experienced
on the occasion of this reunion with my own kith and kin&#8212;people who had stood shoulder to shoulder with me in the desperate
struggles of the 1896&#8211;97 revolution&#8212;is simply indescribable. Words fail to express my feelings&#8212;joy mingled with sadness and
strong determination to accomplish the salvation, the emancipation, of my beloved countrymen. Hardly had I set foot in the
Naval Headquarters at Cavite, at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, than I availed myself of the opportunity to give these faithful
adherents orders similar to those despatched to Bataan and Zambales.

</p>
<p id="d0e348">I was engaged the whole of that night with my companions drawing up orders and circulars for the above mentioned purpose.

</p>
<p id="d0e350">We were also kept very busy replying to letters which were pouring in from all sides asking for news respecting the reported
return of myself to the islands and requesting definite instructions regarding a renewal of hostilities against the Spaniards.

<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e352"></a>Page 21</span></p>
<p id="d0e353">That the invisible, albeit irresistible, hand of Providence was guiding every movement and beneficently favouring all efforts
to rid the country of the detestable foreign yoke is fairly evidenced by the rapid sequence of events above recorded, for
in no other way can one account for the wonderful celebrity with which news of my projected return spread far and wide.

</p>
<p id="d0e355">Sixty-two Volunteers, organized and armed by the Spaniards with Mausers and Remingtons, from San Roque and Caridad, placed
themselves under my orders. At first the Americans apprehended some danger from the presence of this armed force, which was
promptly placed on guard at the entrance to the Arsenal. When I heard of this I went down and gave them orders to occupy Dalajican,
thereby preventing the Spaniards from carrying out their intention to approach Cavite by that route.

</p>
<p id="d0e357">When the Americans were informed of what I had done they were reassured, and orders were given to the Captain of the <i>Petrel</i> to hand over to me the 62 rifles and ammunition which Admiral Dewey had kindly promised. About 10 a.m. the <i>Petrel's</i> launch landed the arms and ammunition in question at the Arsenal and no time was lost in distributing the arms among the
men who were by this time coming in ever increasing numbers to offer their services to me and expressing their willingness
to be armed and assigned for duty at the outposts and on the firing line.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e365"></a>Page 22</span></p>
<p id="d0e366">During the evening of the 20th May the old Revolutionary officer Sr. Luciano San Miguel (now a General in command of a Brigade)
came to me and asked for orders, which were given to him to effect the uprising of the provinces of Manila, Laguna, Batangas,
Tayabas, Bulakan, Morong, Pampanga, Tarlak, Newva Ecija and other northern provinces. He left the same night to execute the orders.

</p>
<p id="d0e371">During the 21st, 22nd and 23rd and subsequent days of that month my headquarters were simply besieged by my countrymen, who
poured into Cavite from all sides to offer their services in the impending struggle with the Spaniards. To such an extent,
indeed, were my quarters in the Arsenal invaded that I soon found it necessary to repair to another house in the town, leaving
the place entirely at the disposal of the U.S. Marines, who were then in charge of and guarding Cavite Arsenal.

</p><a id="d0e373"></a><h1>The Dictatorial Government</h1>
<p id="d0e376">On the 24th May a Dictatorial Government was established, my first proclamation being issued that day announcing the system
of government then adopted and stating that I had assumed the duties and responsibilities of head of such government. Several
copies of this proclamation were delivered to Admiral Dewey and through the favour of his good offices forwarded to the representatives
of the Foreign Powers then residing in Manila, notwithstanding our lack of intercourse with Manila.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e378"></a>Page 23</span></p>
<p id="d0e379">A few days later the Dictatorial Government was removed to the house formerly occupied by the Spanish Civil Governor of Cavite,
because, owing to the great number of visitors from the provinces and the rapid increase of work the accommodation in the
private house was wholly inadequate and too cramped. It was while quartered in the first mentioned house that glad tidings
reached me of the arrival at Cavite of the long-expected arms expedition. The whole cargo, consisting of 1,999 rifles and
200,000 rounds of ammunition, besides other special munitions of war, was landed at the very same dock of the Arsenal, and
was witnessed by the U.S.S. &#8220;<i>Petrel</i>.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e384">I immediately despatched a Commission to convey to the Admiral my thanks for the trouble he had taken in sending to hurry
up the expedition. I also caused my Commissioners to inform the Admiral that I had fixed the 31st May as the day when the
Revolutionary Forces should make a General attack upon the Spaniards. The Admiral returned the compliment by sending his Secretary
to congratulate me and my Government upon the activity and enthusiasm displayed in preparing for the campaign, but he suggested
that it was advisable to postpone the opening of the campaign to a later date in order that the insurgent troops might be
better organized and better drilled. I replied to the Admiral through his Secretary that there was no cause for any anxiety
for everything would be in perfect readiness by the 31st and, moreover, that the Filipinos were very anxious to <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e386"></a>Page 24</span>free themselves from the galling Spanish yoke, that they would therefore fight and my troops would make up for any deficiency
in discipline by a display of fearlessness and determination to defeat the common enemy which would go far to ensure success,
I was, I added, nevertheless profoundly grateful to the Admiral for his friendly advice.

</p>
<p id="d0e388">I promptly gave orders for the distribution of the arms which had just arrived, sending some to various provinces and reserving
the remainder for the revolutionaries of Kawit, the latter being smuggled into the district of Alapang during the night of
27th May.


</p><a id="d0e390"></a><h1>The First Triumphs</h1>
<p id="d0e393">The next day (8th May, 1898), just when we were distributing arms to the revolutionists of Kawit, in the above mentioned district
a column, composed of over 270 Spanish Naval Infantry, appeared in sight. They were sent out by the Spanish General, Sr. Pe&ntilde;a,
for the purpose of seizing the said consignment of arms.

</p>
<p id="d0e395">Then it was that the first engagement of the Revolution of 1898 (which may be rightly styled a continuation of the campaign
of 1896&#8211;97) took place. The battle raged from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., when the Spaniards ran out of ammunition and surrendered,
with all their arms, to the Filipino Revolutionists, who took their prisoners to Cavite. <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e397"></a>Page 25</span>In commemoration of this glorious achievement I hoisted our national flag in presence of a great crowd, who greeted it with
tremendous applause and loud, spontaneous and prolonged cheers for &#8220;Independent Philippines&#8221; and for &#8220;the generous nation&#8221;&#8212;the
United States of America. Several officers and Marines from the American fleet who witnessed the ceremony evinced sympathy
with the Filipino cause by joining in the natural and popular rejoicings of the people.

</p>
<p id="d0e399">This glorious triumph was merely the prelude to a succession of brilliant victories, and when the 31st May came&#8212;the date fixed
for general uprising of the whole of the Philippines&#8212;the people rose as one man to crush the power of Spain.

</p>
<p id="d0e401">The second triumph was effected in Binakayan, at a place known as <i>Polvorin</i>, where the Spanish garrison consisting of about 250 men was attacked by our raw levvies and surrendered in a few hours, their
stock of ammunition being completely exhausted.

</p>
<p id="d0e406">I again availed myself of the opportunity to hoist our national flag and did so from an upper story of the <i>Polvorin</i> facing the sea, with the object of causing the sacred insignia of our Liberty and Independence to be seen fluttering in the
breeze by the warships, representing all the great and civilized nations of the world, which were congregated in the harbour
observing the providential evolution going on in the Philippines after upwards of three hundred years of Spanish domination.

<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e411"></a>Page 26</span></p>
<p id="d0e412">Scarcely had another hour elapsed before another flag was seen flying over the steeple of the Church at Bakoor&#8212;which is also
in full view of vessels in the harbour&#8212;being the signal of another triumph of our troops over the Spanish forces which held
that town. The garrison consisted of about 300 men, who surrendered to the Revolutionary Army when their ammunition was exhausted.

</p>
<p id="d0e414">And so the Revolution progressed, triumph following triumph in quick succession, evidencing the power, resolution and ability
of the inhabitants of the Philippines to rid themselves of any foreign yoke and exist as an independent State, as I affirmed
to Admiral Dewey and in respect of which he and several American Commanders and officers warmly congratulated me, specially
mentioning the undeniable triumphs of the Philippine Army as demonstrated and proved by the great number of prisoners we brought
into Cavite from all parts of Luzon.


</p><a id="d0e416"></a><h1>The Philippine Flag</h1>
<p id="d0e419">In conformity with my orders issued on the 1st of September, all Philippine vessels hoisted the national flag, the Marines
of the Filipino flotilla being the first to execute that order. Our little flotilla consisted of some eight Spanish steam
launches (which had been captured) and five vessels of greater dimensions, namely, the <i>Taale&ntilde;o, Baldyan, Taal, Bulucan</i>, and <i>Purisima Concepcion</i>. <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e427"></a>Page 27</span>These vessels were presented to the Philippine Government by their native owners and were converted by us, at our Arsenal,
into gunboats, 8 and 9 centimetre guns, taken from the <i>sunken Spanish warships</i>, being mounted on board.

</p>
<p id="d0e432">Ah! what a beautiful, inspiring joyous sight that flag was fluttering in the breeze from the topmasts of our vessels, side
by side, as it were, with the ensigns of other and greater nations, among whose mighty warships our little cruisers passed
to and fro dipping their colours, the ensign of Liberty and Independence! With what reverence and adoration it was viewed
as it suddenly rose in its stately loneliness crowning our victories, and, as it were, smiling approvingly upon the undisciplined
Philippine Army in the moment of its triumphs over the regular forces of the Spanish Government! One's heart swells and throbs
again with the emotions of extreme delight; the soul is filled with pride, and the goal of patriotism seems well-nigh reached
in the midst of such a magnificent spectacle!

</p>
<p id="d0e434">At the end of June I called on Admiral Dewey, who, after complimenting me on <i>the rapid triumphs of the Philippine Revolution</i>, told me he had been asked by the German and French Admirals why he allowed the Filipinos to display on their vessels a flag
that was not recognized. Admiral Dewey said his reply to the French and German Admirals was&#8212;with <i>his knowledge and consent the Filipinos used that flag</i>, and, apart from this, <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e442"></a>Page 28</span>he was of opinion that in view of the courage and steadfastness of purpose displayed in the war against the Spaniards the
Filipinos deserved the right to use their flag.

</p>
<p id="d0e444">I thereupon expressed to the Admiral my unbounded gratitude for such unequivocal protection, and on returning to the shore
immediately ordered the Philippine flotilla to convey troops to the other provinces of Luzon and to the Southern islands,
to wage war against the Spaniards who garrisoned them.

</p><a id="d0e446"></a><h1>Expedition to Bisayas</h1>
<p id="d0e449">The expedition to Bisayas was a complete success as far as the conveyance of our troops to the chief strategic points was
concerned, our steamers returning safely to Cavite after landing the soldiers. The steamer <i>Bulusan</i>, however, which sailed for Masbate with Colonel Sr. Mariano Riego de Dios' column destined for duty in Samar was sighted
by the Spanish gunboats <i>Elcano</i> and <i>Uranus</i>, which gave chase, and the former proving the faster overtook and attacked the <i>Bulusan</i> doing so much damage to her that she foundered after a hot engagement in which considerable damage was done to the Spaniard.
Happily the crew and troops on board of the <i>Bulusan</i> saved their lives by swimming ashore.


</p><a id="d0e466"></a><h1>The Steamer &#8220;Compania de Filipinas&#8221;</h1>
<p id="d0e469">In a few days the Spanish steamer <i>Compania de Filipinas</i> was brought to Cavite by my countrymen, <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e474"></a>Page 29</span>who captured her in the harbour of Aparri. Cannon were at once mounted on board this vessel and she was loaded with troops
and despatched for Olongapo, but she had not gone far before I sent another gunboat to recall her because Admiral Dewey requested
me to do so in order that a question raised by the French Consul might be duly settled. The Admiral having been informed that
when captured the <i>Compania de Filipinas</i> was flying the Spanish flag abstained from interfering in the matter and handed the French Consul's protest over to me, affirming
at the same time that <i>he and his forces were in no way concerned in the matter</i>.

</p>
<p id="d0e482">This incident, which was soon settled, clearly demonstrates the recognition of and protection extended to the Philippine Revolution
by Admiral Dewey.

</p>
<p id="d0e484">The <i>Filipinas</i> (as this steamer has since been styled) was again despatched to Olongapo and on her way back landed troops in the provinces
of Cagayan and the Batanes islands for the purpose of wresting the government of those districts from Spain. This steamer,
whose name has more recently been changed to <i>Luzon</i>, is at present ashore in the Rio Grande, in Cagayan, where she was beached owing to some damage to her machinery.

</p>
<p id="d0e492">When our steamers were leaving the harbour with troops for the provinces they dipped their ensigns in passing Admiral Dewey's
flagship <i>Olympia</i>, performing this act in conformity with the rules of international courtesy, a demonstration <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e497"></a>Page 30</span>of friendship that was invariably promptly responded to in the usual way.


</p><a id="d0e499"></a><h1>The Proclamation of Independence</h1>
<p id="d0e502">The Dictatorial Government decided that the proclamation of Independence should take place on the 12th June, the ceremony
in connection therewith to be held in the town of Kawit. With this object in view I sent a Commission to inform the Admiral
of the arrangement and invite him to be present on the occasion of the formal proclamation of Independence, a ceremony which
was solemnly and impressively conducted. The Admiral sent his Secretary to excuse him from taking part in the proceedings,
stating the day fixed for the ceremony was mail day.

</p>
<p id="d0e504">About the end of that month (June) the Spanish gunboat <i>Leyte</i> escaped from the Macabebe river and reached Manila Bay, where she was seized by General Torres' troops. She had on board
part of the troops and volunteers which were under the command of the Filipino Colonel Sr. Eugenio Blanco, but on being sighted
by an American gunboat she voluntarily surrendered. Admiral Dewey delivered to me all the prisoners and arms on board the
vessel, which latter, however, he took possession of; but after the fall of Manila he demanded that I should give back the
prisoners to him.

</p>
<p id="d0e509">On the 4th July the first United States military expedition arrived, under command of General <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e511"></a>Page 31</span>Anderson, and it was quartered in Cavite Arsenal. This distinguished General called on me in the Filipino Government House
at Cavite, an honour and courtesy which I promptly returned, as was right and proper, seeing that we were friends, of equal
rank, and allies. In the course of official intercourse General Anderson solemnly and completely endorsed the promises made
by Admiral Dewey to me, asserting on his word of honour that America had not come to the Philippines to wage war against the
natives nor to conquer and retain territory, but only to liberate the people from the oppression of the Spanish Government.

</p>
<p id="d0e513">A few days before the arrival of this military expedition, and others that followed under command of General Merritt, Admiral
Dewey sent his Secretary to my Government to ask me to grant permission for the stationing of American troops in Tambo and
Maytubig, Paranaque and Pasay. In view of the important promises of Admiral Dewey, above mentioned, the Dictatorial Government
consented to the movement of troops as proposed.

</p>
<p id="d0e515">During that month (July) Admiral Dewey accompanied by General Anderson visited Cavite, and after the usual exchange of courtesies
he said&#8212;&#8220;You have had ocular demonstration and confirmation of all I have told you and promised you. How pretty your flag
is! It has a triangle, and is something like the Cubans'. Will you give me one as a memento when I go back home?&#8221;
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e517"></a>Page 32</span></p>
<p id="d0e518">I replied that I was fully satisfied with his word of honour and of the needlessness of having our agreement in documentary
form. As to the flag he wanted, he could have one whenever he wished.

</p>
<p id="d0e520">The Admiral continued: <i>Documents are useless when there is no sense of honour on one side, as was the case in respect of the compact with the Spaniards,
who failed to act up to what had been written and signed. Have faith in my word, and I assure you that the United States will
recognize the independence of the country. But I recommend you to keep a good deal of what we have said and agreed secret
at present. I further request you to have patience if any of our soldiers insult any Filipinos, for being Volunteers they
are as yet undisciplined</i>.

</p>
<p id="d0e525">I replied that I would bear in mind all his advice regarding cautiousness, and that with respect to the misconduct of the
soldiers orders had already been issued enjoining forbearance, and I passed the same remarks to the Admiral about unpleasantness
possibly arising through lack of discipline of our own forces.


</p><a id="d0e527"></a><h1>The Spanish Commission</h1>
<p id="d0e530">At this juncture the Admiral suddenly changed the topic of conversation and asked&#8212;&#8220;Why don't the people in Manila rise against
the Spaniards as their countrymen in the provinces have done? Is it true that they accept the <i>autonomy</i> offered by General Augustin with a representative <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e535"></a>Page 33</span>Assembly? Is the report which has reached me true, that a Filipino Commission has been sent from Manila to propose to you
the acceptance of that <i>autonomy</i> coupled with a recognition of your rank of General, as well as recognition of the rank held by your companions?&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e540">&#8220;The people of Manila,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;are quiet because they have no arms and because as merchants and landlords they fear
that their valuable properties and money in the banks will be confiscated by the Spaniards if they rise up and begin burning
and destroying the property of others. On this account they had ostensibly accepted <i>autonomy</i>, not because that was what they wanted but more as a means of deceiving the Spaniards and being allowed to live in peace;
but I am confident that all the Filipinos in Manila are for <i>independence</i>, as will be proved the very day our troops capture Manila. At that time I fully expect the people of Manila will join with
us in raising loud cheers for the Independence of the Philippines, making fresh demonstrations of loyalty to our Government.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e548">I also told him it was true that a Mixed Commission had arrived and in the name of General Augustin and Archbishop Nozaleda
made certain proposals; but they made known to us their intention to adhere to our Cause. The members of the Commission said
the Spaniards instructed them to say they came <i>motu propio</i><a id="d0e552src" href="#d0e552" class="noteref">1</a> without being formally <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e558"></a>Page 34</span>appointed or 'coached' by the Spanish authorities in what they should say, representing, on the contrary, that they were faithful
interpreters of the sentiment of the people of Manila and that they had good reason for believing that if I was willing to
accept <i>autonomy</i> General Augustin and Archbishop Nozaleda would recognize my rank of General, and that of my companions, would give me the
$1,000,000 indemnity agreed upon at Biak-na-bat&oacute; and still unpaid, as well as liberal rewards for and salaries to the members
of a popular Assembly promises which the Commissioners did not put any faith in, though some of them held the opinion that
the money should be accepted because it would reduce the funds of the Spanish Government and also because the money had been
wrung from Filipinos. The Commissioners, I added, left after assuring me that the people in Manila would rise against the
Spaniards if supplied with arms, and that the best thing I could do was to make an attack on Manila at the places they pointed
out as being the weakest parts of the Spanish defense and consequently the easiest to overcome.

</p>
<p id="d0e563">I thanked the Commission for their loyalty and straightforwardness, told them they would be given an escort to take them safely
back to the Spanish lines, and that when they got back they should inform those who had sent them that they were not received
because they were not duly accredited and that even if they had brought credentials according to what they had seen and heard
from the Revolutionists Don Emilio Aguinaldo would certainly <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e565"></a>Page 35</span>not consider, much less accept, their proposals respecting autonomy because the Filipino people had sufficient experience
to govern themselves, that they are tired of being victimised and subjected to gross abuses by a foreign nation under whose
domination they have no wish to continue to live, but rather wish for their <i>independence</i>. Therefore the Spaniards might prepare to defend their sovereignty, for the Filipino Army would vigorously assault the city
and with unflagging zeal prosecute the siege until Manila was captured.

</p>
<p id="d0e570">I also told the Commissioners to tell Archbishop Nozaleda that he was abusing the privileges and authority of his exalted
position; that such conduct was at variance with the precepts of His Holiness the Pope, and if he failed to rectify matters
I would throw light on the subject in a way which would bring shame and disgrace upon him. I added that I knew he and General
Augustin had commissioned four Germans and five Frenchmen to disguise themselves and assassinate me in the vain hope that
once I am disposed of the people of the Philippines would calmly submit to the sovereignty of Spain, which was a great mistake,
for were I assassinated, the inhabitants of the Philippines would assuredly continue the struggle with greater vigor than
ever. Other men would come forward to avenge my death. Lastly I recommended the Commissioners to tell the people in Manila
to go on with their trades and industries and be perfectly at ease about our Government, whose actions were guided in the
paths of rectitude and justice, and <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e572"></a>Page 36</span>that since there were no more Friars to corrupt the civic virtues, the Filipino Government was now endeavouring to demonstrate
its honesty of purpose before the whole world. There was therefore no reason why they should not go on with their business
as usual and should not think of leaving Manila and coming into the Camp, where the resources were limited, where already more were employed than was necessary to meet the requirements of the Government and the Army,
and where, too, the lack of arms was sorely felt.

</p>
<p id="d0e577">The Commissioners asked me what conditions the United States would impose and what benefits they would confer on the Filipinos,
to which I replied that is was difficult to answer that question in view of the secret I was in honour bound to keep in respect
of the terms of the Agreement, contenting myself by saying that they could learn a good deal by carefully observing the acts,
equivalent to the exercise of sovereign rights, of the Dictatorial Government, and especially the occular demonstrations of
such rights on the waters of the harbour.

</p>
<p id="d0e579">These statements, which were translated by my interpreter, Sr. Leyba, made such an impression on the Admiral that he interrupted,
asking&#8212;&#8220;Why did you reveal our secret?&#8221; Do you mean that you do not intend to keep inviolate our well understood silence and
watchword?

</p>
<p id="d0e581">I said in reply that I had revealed nothing of the secret connected with him and the Consul.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e583"></a>Page 37</span></p>
<p id="d0e584">The Admiral then thanked me for my cautiousness, bid we good-by and left with General Anderson, after requesting me to refrain
from assaulting Manila because, he said, they were studying a plan to take the Walled City with their troops, leaving the
suburbs for the Filipino forces.

</p>
<p id="d0e586">He advised me, nevertheless, to study other plans of taking the city in conjunction with their forces, which I agreed to do.

</p>
</div><a id="d0e588"></a><h1>More American Troops</h1>
<p id="d0e591">A few days later American troops arrived, and with them came General Merritt. The Admiral's Secretary and two officers came
to the Dictatoriat Government and asked that we allow them to occupy our trenches at Maytubig; from the harbour side of that
place right up to the main road, where they would form a continuation of our lines at Pasay and Singalong. This I also agreed
to on account of the solemn promises of the Admiral and the trust naturally placed in them owing to the assistance rendered
and recognition of our independence.

</p>
<p id="d0e593">Ten days after the Americans occupied the trenches at Maytubig (this move being well known by the Spaniards who were entrenched
at the Magazine in San Antonio Abad) their outposts, composed of a few men only, were surprised by the Spaniards, who made
a night attack on them. They had barely time to get out of their beds and fall back on the centre, abandoning their rifles
and six field-guns in their precipitate retreat.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e595"></a>Page 38</span></p>
<p id="d0e596">The firing being distinctly heard, our troops immediately rushed to the assistance of our friends and allies, repulsing the
Spaniards and recapturing the rifles and field-guns, which I ordered to be returned to the Americans as a token of our good-will
and friendship.

</p>
<p id="d0e598">General Noriel was opposed to this restitution, alleging that the arms did not belong to the Americans since the Filipino
troops captured them from the Spaniards. But I paid no attention to the reasonable opposition of my General and gave imperative
instructions that they be returned to the Americans, showing thereby clearly and positively the good-will of the Filipinos.
The said rifles and field-guns, with a large quantity of ammunition, was therefore restored to those who were then our allies,
notwithstanding the fact of General Noriel's brigade capturing them at a cost of many lives of our compatriots.

</p>
<p id="d0e600">Later on more American reinforcements arrived and again Admiral Dewey, through his Secretary, asked for more trenches for
their troops, averring that those which we had given up to them before were insufficient. We at once agreed and their lines
were then extended up to Pasay.

</p><a id="d0e602"></a><h1>The Thirteenth of August</h1>
<p id="d0e605">The 13th August arrived, on which day I noticed a general advance of the American land <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e607"></a>Page 39</span>and sea forces towards Manila, the former being under command of General Anderson at Paranaque.

</p>
<p id="d0e609">Subsequently I ordered a general assault of the Spanish lines and in the course of this movement General Pio del Pilar succeeded
in advancing through Sampalok and attacked the Spanish troops who where defending the Puente Colgante,<a id="d0e611src" href="#d0e611" class="noteref">1</a> causing the enemy to fall back on the Bridge of Spain. The column commanded by our General, Sr. Gregorio II. del Pilar, took
the suburbs of Pretil, Tendo, Divisoria and Paseo de Azcarraga, situated north of Manila city; while General Noriel's command,
near Pasay, took the suburbs of Singalong and Pako, and following the American column he out-flanked the Spaniards who were
defending San Antonio Abad. The Spanish officers observing General Noriel's move ordered their men to retreat towards the
Walled City, whereupon the Americans who held the foremost trenches entered Malate and Ermita without firing a shot. At this
point the Americans met General Noriel's troops who had captured the above mentioned suburbs and were quartered in the building
formerly used by the Exposicion Regional de Filipinas,<a id="d0e617src" href="#d0e617" class="noteref">2</a> in the Normal, and in Sr. Perez' house in Paco.

</p>
<p id="d0e623">In Santa Ana (the eastern section of Manila) General Ricarto successfully routed five companies of Spaniards, being aided
in this by the manoeuvres of General Pio del Pilar's brigade.

</div><a id="d0e626"></a><h1>First Clouds</h1>
<p id="d0e629">Our troops saw the American forces landing on the sea shore near the Luneta and Paseo de Santa Lucia, calling the attention
of everybody to the fact that the Spanish soldiers in the city forts were not firing on them (the Americans), a mystery that
was cleared up at sunset when details of the capitulation of Manila, by General Jaudenes in accordance with terms of an agreement
with General Merritt, became public property&#8212;a capitulation which the American Generals reserved for their own benefit and
credit in contravention of the agreement arrived at with Admiral Dewey in the arrangement of plans for the final combined
assault on and <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e631"></a>Page 41</span>capture of Manila by the allied forces, American and Filipino.

</p>
<p id="d0e633">Some light was thrown upon this apparently inexplicable conduct of the American Commanders by the telegrams which I received
during that day from General Anderson, who wired me from Maitubig asking me to issue orders forbidding our troops to enter
Manila, a request which I did not comply with because it was not in conformity with the agreement, and it was, moreover, diametrically
opposed to the high ends of the Revolutionary Government, that after going to the trouble of besieging Manila for two months
and a half, sacrificing thousands of lives and millions of material interests, it should be supposed such sacrifices were
made with any other object in view than the capture of Manila and the Spanish garrison which stubbornly defended the city.

</p>
<p id="d0e635">But General Merritt, persistent in his designs, begged me not only through the Admiral but also through Major Bell to withdraw
my troops from the suburbs to (as it was argued) prevent the danger of conflict which is always to be looked for in the event
of dual military occupation; also by so doing to avoid bringing ridicule upon the American forces; offering, at the same time,
in three letters, to negotiate after his wishes were complied with. To this I agreed, though neither immediately nor at one
time, but making our troops retire gradually up to the blockhouses in order that the whole of the inhabitants of Manila should
witness the proceedings of our troops and amicability toward our American allies.

</p>
<p id="d0e637">Up to that time, and in fact right up to the time when the Americans openly commenced hostilities against us, I entertained
in my soul strong hopes that the American Commanders would make absolute with their Government the verbal agreement made and
entered into with the Leader of the Philippine Revolution, notwithstanding the indications to the contrary which were noticeable
in their conduct, especially in respect of the conduct of Admiral Dewey, who, without any reason or justification, one day
in the month of October seized all our steamers and launches.

</p>
<p id="d0e639">Being informed of this strange proceeding, and at the time when the Revolutionary Government <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e641"></a>Page 42</span>had its headquarters in Malolos, I despatched a Commission to General Otis to discuss the matter with him. General Otis gave
the Commissioners a letter of recommendation to the Admiral to whom he referred them; but the Admiral declined to receive
the Commission notwithstanding General Otis's recommendation.

</p>
<p id="d0e643">Notwithstanding the procedure of the American Commanders, so contrary to the spirit of all the compacts and antecedents above
mentioned, I continued to maintain a friendly attitude towards them, sending a Commission to General Merritt to bid him farewell
on the eve of his departure for Paris. In his acknowledgement of his courtesy General Merritt was good enough to say that
he would advocate the Filipino Cause in the United States. In the same manner I sent to Admiral Dewey a <i>punal</i><a id="d0e647src" href="#d0e647" class="noteref">1</a> in a solid silver scabbard and a walking stick of the very best cane with gold handle engraved by the most skilful silversmiths
as a souvenir and mark of our friendship. This the Admiral accepted, thereby in some measure relieving my feelings and the
anxiety of my compatriots constituting the Revolutionary Government, whose hearts were again filled with pleasant hopes of
a complete understanding with Admiral Dewey.

</p>
</div><a id="d0e653"></a><h1>Vain Hopes</h1>
<p id="d0e656">Vain indeed became these hope when news arrived that Admiral Dewey had acted and was <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e658"></a>Page 43</span>continuing to act against the Revolutionary Government by order of His Excellency Mr. McKinley, who, prompted by the &#8220;Imperialist&#8221;
party, had decided to annex the Philippines, granting, in all probability, concessions to adventurers to exploit the immense
natural wealth lying concealed under our virgin soil.

</p>
<p id="d0e660">This news was received in the Revolutionary camp like a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. Some cursed the hour and the day we
treated verbally with the Americans; some denounced the ceding of the suburbs, while others again were of opinion that a Commission
should be sent to General Otis to draw from him clear and positive declarations on the situation, drawing up a treaty of amity
and commerce if the United States recognize our independence or at once commence hostilities if the States refused.

</p>
<p id="d0e662">In this crisis I advised moderation and prudence, for I still had confidence in the justice and rectitude of United States
Congress, which, I believed, would not approve the designs of the Imperialist party and would give heed to the declarations
of <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e664"></a>Page 44</span>Admiral Dewey, who, in the capacity of an exalted Representative of the United States in these Islands concerted and covenanted
with me and the people of the Philippines recognition of our independence.

</p>
<p id="d0e666">In fact in no other way was such a serious matter to be regarded, for if America entrusted to Admiral Dewey the honour of
her forces in such a distant region, surely the Filipinos might equally place their trust in the word of honour of such a
polished, chivalrous gentleman and brave sailor, in the firm belief, of course, that the great and noble American people would
neither reject his decision nor expose to ridicule the illustrious conqueror of the Spanish fleet.

</p>
<p id="d0e668">In the same way the not less known and notorious circumstances, that the American Commanders who came soon after the echoes
of the Admiral's victory reached their native shores, namely, Generals Merritt, Anderson and Otis, proclaimed to the people
of the Philippines that America <i>did not come to conquer territories, but to liberate its inhabitants from the oppression of Spanish Sovereignty</i>. I would therefore also expose to universal ridicule and contempt the honour of these Commanders if the United States, by
repudiating their official and public acts, attempts to annex these islands by conquest.


</p><a id="d0e673"></a><h1>The American Commission</h1>
<p id="d0e676">With such prudent as well as well founded reflections, I succeeded in calming my companions shortly before the official news
arrived reporting that the Washington Government, acting on Admiral Dewey's suggestion, had intimated its intention to despatch
a Civil Commission to Manila which would treat with the Filipinos with a view <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e678"></a>Page 45</span>to arriving at a definite understanding respecting the government of the Islands.

</p>
<p id="d0e680">Joy and satisfaction now filled the breasts of all the Revolutionists, and I thereupon set about the appointment of a Commission
to meet the American Commissioners. At the same time I gave strict orders that the most friendly relations should be maintained
with the Americans, enjoining toleration and overlooking of the abuses and atrocities of the soldiery because the effect on
the Commissioners would not be good it they found us at loggerheads with their nation's forces.

</p>
<p id="d0e682">But the abases of the Americans were now becoming intolerable. In the market-place at Arroceros they killed a woman and a
little boy under the pretext that they were surprising a gambling den, thus causing the greatest indignation of a great concourse
of people in that vicinity.

</p>
<p id="d0e684">My Adjutants, too, who hold passes permitting them to enter Manila with their uniform and sidearms, were molested by being
repeatedly stopped by every patrol they met, it, being perfectly evident that, the intention was to irritate them by exposing
them to public ridicule.

</p>
<p id="d0e686">While this sort of thing was going on as against our people the American Commanders and officers who visited our camp were
treated with the utmost courtesy and consideration.

</p>
<p id="d0e688">In Lacoste Street an American guard shot and killed a boy seven years of age for taking a banana from a Chinaman.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e690"></a>Page 46</span></p>
<p id="d0e691">The searching of houses was carried on just as it was during the Spanish regime, while the American soldiers at the outposts
often invaded our lines, thus irritating our sentries. It would make this book a very large volume if I continued to state
seriatim the abuses and atrocities committed by the American soldiery in those days of general anxiety.

</p>
<p id="d0e693">It seemed as if the abuses were authorised or at least winked at in official quarters for the purpose of provoking an outbreak
of hostilities. Excitement ran high among all classes of people, but the Filipino Government, which had assumed responsibility
for the acts of the people, by the constant issue of prudent orders succeeded in calming the excited populace and maintained
peace, advising all sufferers to be patient and prudent pending the arrival of the Civil Commission.


</p><a id="d0e695"></a><h1>Impolitic Acts</h1>
<p id="d0e698">At such a critical juncture as this, and before the anxiously-awaited Civil Commission arrived, it occurred to General Otis,
Commandant of the American forces, to commit two more impolitic acts. One of them was the order to search our telegraph offices
in Sagunro Street, in Tondo, where the searching party seized the apparatus and detained the officer in charge, Sr. Reyna,
in the Fuerza Santiago<a id="d0e700src" href="#d0e700" class="noteref">1</a> under the pretext that he was conspiring against the Americans.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e703"></a>Page 47</span></p>
<p id="d0e704">How and why was Sr. Reyna conspiring? Was not this sufficient for the Filipino Government to give the order to attack and
rescue Reyna and thereby we (eight thousand strong) be plunged immediately into war with the United States? Was there any
reason for conspiring when the power was in our own hands? And, above all, would a telegraphist, be likely to interfere in
<i>affaires de guerre</i> when there was an army near by to attend to such matters?

</p>
<p id="d0e709">It was abundantly manifest that the object was by wounding the feelings of and belittling the Filipino Government to provoke
a collision, and it was clear also that this system of exasperating us was not merely the wanton act of the soldiery but was
actually prompted by General Otis himself, who, imbued with imperialistic tendencies, regarded the coming of the Civil Commission
with disfavour and especially would it be unsatisfactory that this Commission should find the Philippines in a state of perfect
tranquility, because it was evident to the said General, as well as to the whole world, that the Filipinos would assuredly
have arrived at a definite amicable agreement with the aforesaid Commission if it reached the islands while peace prevailed.

</p>
<p id="d0e711">We, the Filipinos, would have received the Commission with open arms and complete accord as honourable Agents of the great
American nation. The Commissioners could have visited all our provinces, seeing and taking note of the complete tranquility
throughout our territory. They <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e713"></a>Page 48</span>could have seen our cultivated lands, examined our Constitution and investigated the administration of public affairs in perfect
peace and safety, and have felt and enjoyed the inimitable charm of our Oriental style,&#8212;half negligent, half solicitude, warmth
and chilliness, simple confidence and suspiciousness; characteristics which cause descriptions of contact with us to be depicted
by foreigners in thousands of different hues.

</p>
<p id="d0e715">Ah! but neither did General Otis nor the Imperialists wish for such a landscape. It was better for their criminal designs
that the American Commission should view the desolation and horrors of war in the Philippines, inhaling on the very day of
their arrival the revolting odour emitted from American and Filipino corpses. It was better for their purposes that that gentleman,
Mr. Schurman, President of the Commission, should return from Manila, limiting his investigation to inquiries among the few
Filipinos, who, seduced with gold, were siding with the Imperialists. It were better for them that the Commission should view
the Philippines problem through fire and slaughter, in the midst of whizzing bullets and the uncontrolled passion of infuriated
foes, thus preventing them from forming correct judgment of the exact and natural conditions of the problem. Ah! it was, lastly,
better that the Commission return to the States defeated in its mission of obtaining peace and blaming me and other Filipinos
for its inability to settle matters, when, in reality, I and all the Philippine people were longing that that <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e717"></a>Page 49</span>peace had been concluded yesterday,&#8212;long before now&#8212;but an honest and honourable peace, honourable alike for the United States
and the Philippine Republic in order that it be sincere and everlasting.

</p>
<p id="d0e719">The second impolitic act of General Otis was the issue of a proclamation on the 4th of January, 1899, asserting in the name
of President McKinley the sovereignty of America in these islands, with threats of ruin, death and desolation to all who declined
to recognize it.

</p>
<p id="d0e721">I, Emilio Aguinaldo&#8212;though the humble servant of all, am, as President of the Philippine Republic, charged with the safeguarding
of the rights and independence of the people who appointed me to such an exalted position of trust and responsibility&#8212;mistrusted
for the first time the honour of the Americans, perceiving of course that this proclamation of General Otis completely exceeded
the limits of prudence and that therefore no other course was open to me but to repel with arms such unjust and unexpected
procedure on the part of the commander of friendly forces.

</p>
<p id="d0e723">I protested, therefore, against such a proclamation&#8212;also threatening an immediate rupture of friendly relations,&#8212;for the whole
populace was claiming that an act of treason had been committed, plausibly asserting that the announcement of the Commission
applied for by Admiral Dewey was a ruse, and that what General Otis was scheming for was to keep us quiet while he brought
reinforcement after reinforcement from the United <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e725"></a>Page 50</span>States for the purpose of crashing our untrained and badly equipped Army with one blow.

</p>
<p id="d0e727">But now General Otis acted for the first time like a diplomatist, and wrote me, through his Secretary, Mr. Carman, a letter
inviting the Filipino Government to send a Commission to meet an American Commission for the purpose of arriving at an amicable
arrangement between both parties; and although I placed no trust in the professions of friendly intentions of the said General&#8212;whose
determination to prevent the Commission arriving at a peaceful solution of the difficulties was already evident&#8212;I acceded
to the request, partly because I saw the order, dated 9th January, given by the above mentioned General confirmed, and on
the other hand to show before the whole world my manifest wishes for the conservation of peace and friendship with the United
States, solemnly compacted with Admiral Dewey.

</p>
</div><a id="d0e729"></a><h1>The Mixed Commission</h1>
<p id="d0e732">Conferences of the Mixed Commission, Americans and Filipinos, were held in Manila from the 11th to the 31st of the said month
of January, the Filipino Commissioners clearly expressing the wish of our people for recognition as an independent nation.

</p>
<p id="d0e734">They also frankly stated the complaints of the Filipino people about the abuses and atrocities of the American soldiery, being
attentively and <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e736"></a>Page 51</span>benevolently listened to by the American Commissioners. The latter replied that they had no authority to recognize the Filipino
Government, their mission being limited to hearing what the Filipinos said, to collect data to formulate the will of our people
and transmit it fully and faithfully to the Government of Washington, who alone could arrive at a definite decision on the
subject. These conferences ended in perfect harmony, auguring well for happier times and definite peace when Mr. McKinley
should reply to General Otis's telegrams transmitting our wishes with his favourable recommendations, as the American Commissioners
said.


</p><a id="d0e738"></a><h1>Outbreak of Hostilities</h1>
<p id="d0e741">While I, the Government, the Congress and the entire populace were awaiting the arrival of such a greatly desired reply, many
fairly overflowing with pleasant thoughts, there came the fatal day of the 4th February, during the night of which day the
American forces suddenly attacked all our lines, which were in fact at the time almost deserted, because being Saturday, the
day before a regular feast day, our Generals and some of the most prominent officers had obtained leave to pass the Sabbath
with their respective families.

</p>
<p id="d0e743">General Pantaleon Garcia was the only one who at such a critical moment was at his post in Maypajo, north of Manila, Generals
Noriel, Rizal and Ricarte and Colonels San Miguel, Cailles and others being away enjoying their leave.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e745"></a>Page 52</span></p>
<p id="d0e746">General Otis, according to trustworthy information, telegraphed to Washington stating that the Filipinos had attacked the
American Army. President McKinley read aloud the telegram in the Senate, where the Treaty of Paris of the 10th December, 1898,
was being discussed with a view to its ratification, the question of annexation of the Philippines being the chief subject
of debate, and through this criminal procedure secured the acceptation of the said Treaty <i>in toto</i> by a majority of only three votes,<a id="d0e751src" href="#d0e751" class="noteref">1</a> which were cast simultaneously with a declaration that the voters sided with the &#8220;Ayes&#8221; on account of war having broken out
in these Islands.

</p>
<p id="d0e757">This singular comedy could not continue for a great length of time because the Filipinos could never be the aggressors as
against the American forces, with whom we had sworn eternal friendship and in whose power we expected to find the necessary
protection to enable us to obtain recognition of our independence from the other Powers.

</p>
<p id="d0e759">The confusion and obfuscation of the first moments was indeed great, but before long it gave place to the light of Truth which
shone forth serene, bringing forth serious reflections.

</p>
<p id="d0e761">When sensible people studied the acts of Mr. McKinley, sending reinforcement after reinforcement to Manila at a time after
an armistice was agreed upon and even when peace with Spain <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e763"></a>Page 53</span>prevailed; when they took into account that the despatch of the Civil Commission to settle terms of a treaty of amity with
the Filipinos was being delayed; when, too, they knew of the antecedents of my alliance with Admiral Dewey, prepared and arranged
by the American Consuls of Singapore and Hongkong, Mr. Pratt and Mr. Wildman; when they became acquainted with the actual
state of affairs on the 4th February knowing that the Filipinos were awaiting the reply of Mr. McKinley to the telegram of
General Otis in which he transmitted the peaceful wish of the Filipino people of live as an independent nation; when, lastly,
they riveted their attention to the terms of the Treaty of Paris, the approval of which, in as far as it concerned the annexation
of the Philippines, was greeted with manifestations of joy and satisfaction by the Imperialist party led by Mr. McKinley,
then their eyes were opened to the revelations of truth, clearly perceiving the base, selfish and inhuman policy which Mr.
McKinley had followed in his dealings with us the Filipinos, sacrificing remorselessly to their unbridled ambition the honour
of Admiral Dewey, exposing this worthy gentleman and illustrious conqueror of the Spanish fleet to universal ridicule; for
no other deduction can follow from the fact that about the middle of May of 1898, the U.S.S. <i>McCulloch</i> brought me with my revolutionary companions from Hongkong, by order of the above mentioned Admiral, while now actually the
United States squadron is engaged in bombarding the towns and ports held by these <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e768"></a>Page 54</span>revolutionists, whose objective is and always has been Liberty and Independence.

</p>
<p id="d0e770">The facts as stated are of recent date and must still be fresh in the memory of all.

</p>
<p id="d0e772">Those who in May, 1898, admired the courage of Admiral Dewey's sailors and the humanitarianism of this illustrious Commander
in granting visible aid to an oppressed people to obtain freedom and independence, surely cannot place an honest construction
upon the present inhuman war when contrasting it with those lofty and worthy sentiments.

</p>
<p id="d0e774">I need not dwell on the cruelty which, from the time of the commencement of hostilities, has characterized General Otis's
treatment of the Filipinos, shooting in secret many who declined to sign a petition asking for autonomy. I need not recapitulate
the ruffianly abuses which the American soldiers committed on innocent and defenseless people in Manila, shooting women and
children simply because they were leaning out of windows; entering houses at midnight without the occupants' permission&#8212;forcing
open trunks and wardrobes and stealing money, jewellery and all valuables they came across; breaking chairs, tables and mirrors
which they could not carry away with them, because, anyhow, they are consequences of the war, though improper in the case
of civilized forces. But what I would not leave unmentioned is the inhuman conduct of that General in his dealings with the
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e776"></a>Page 55</span>Filipino Army, when, to arrange a treaty of peace with the Civil Commission, of which Mr. Schurman was President, I thrice
sent emissaries asking for a cessation of hostilities.

</p>
<p id="d0e778">General Otis refused the envoys' fair and reasonable request, replying that he would not stop hostilities so long as the Philippine
Army declined to lay down their arms.

</p>
<p id="d0e780">But why does not this Army deserve some consideration at the hands of General Otis and the American forces? Had they already
forgotten the important service the Filipino Army rendered to the Americans in the late war with Spain?

</p>
<p id="d0e782">Had General Otis forgotten the favours conferred on him by the Filipino Army, giving up to him and his Army the suburbs and
blockhouses which at such great sacrifice to themselves the Filipinos had occupied?

</p>
<p id="d0e784">Why should General Otis make such a humiliating condition a prime factor or basis of terms of peace with an Army which stood
shoulder to shoulder with the American forces, freely shedding its blood, and whose heroism and courage were extolled by Admiral
Dewey and other Americans?

</p>
<p id="d0e786">This unexplained conduct of General Otis, so manifestly contrary to the canons of international law and military honour, is
eloquent testimony of his deliberate intention to neutralize the effects of Mr. Schurman's pacific mission.

</p>
<p id="d0e788">What peace can be concerted by the roaring of cannon and the whizzing of bullets?
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e790"></a>Page 56</span></p>
<p id="d0e791">What is and has been the course of procedure of General Brooke in Cuba? Are not the Cubans still armed, notwithstanding negotiations
for the pacification and future government of that Island are still going on?

</p>
<p id="d0e793">Are we, perchance, less deserving of liberty and independence than those revolutionists?

</p>
<p id="d0e795">Oh, dear Philippines! Blame your wealth, your beauty for the stupendous disgrace that rests upon your faithful sons.

</p>
<p id="d0e797">You have aroused the ambition of the Imperialists and Expansionists of North America and both have placed their sharp claws
upon your entrails!

</p>
<p id="d0e799">Loved mother, sweet mother, we are here to defend your liberty and independence to the death! We do not want war; on the contrary,
we wish for peace; but honourable peace, which does not make you blush nor stain your forehead with shame and confusion. And
we swear to you and promise that while America with all her power and wealth could possibly vanquish us; killing all of us;
but enslave us, never!!!

</p>
<p id="d0e801">No; this humiliation is not the compact I celebrated in Singapore with the American Consul Pratt. This was not the agreement
stipulated for with Mr. Wildman, American Consul in Hongkong. Finally, it was not the subjection of my beloved country to
a new alien yoke that Admiral Dewey promised me.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e803"></a>Page 57</span></p>
<p id="d0e804">It is certain that these three have abandoned me, forgetting that I was sought for and taken from my exile and deportation;
forgetting, also, that neither of these three solicited my services in behalf of American Sovereignty, they paying the expense
of the Philippine Revolution for which, manifestly, they sought me and brought me back to your beloved bosom!

</p>
<p id="d0e806">If there is, as I believe, one God, the root and fountain of all justice and only eternal judge of international disputes,
it will not take long, dear mother, to save you from the hands, of your unjust enemies. So I trust in the honour of Admiral
Dewey: So I trust in the rectitude of the great people of the United States of America, where, if there are ambitious Imperialists,
there are defenders of the humane doctrines of the immortal Monroe, Franklin, and Washington; unless the race of noble citizens,
glorious founders of the present greatness of the North American Republic, have so degenerated that their benevolent influence
has become subservient to the grasping ambition of the Expansionists, in which latter unfortunate circumstance would not death
be preferable to bondage?

</p>
<p id="d0e808">Oh, sensible American people! Deep is the admiration of all the Philippine people and of their untrained Army of the courage
displayed by your Commanders and soldiers. We are weak in comparison with such Titanic instruments of your Government's ambitious
Caesarian policy and find it difficult to effectively resist their courageous <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e810"></a>Page 58</span>onslaught. Limited are our warlike resources, but we will continue this unjust, bloody, and unequal struggle, not for the
love of war&#8212;which we abhor&#8212;but to defend our incontrovertible rights of Liberty and Independence (so dearly won in war with
Spain) and our territory which is threatened by the ambitions of <i>a party</i> that is trying to subjugate us.

</p>
<p id="d0e815">Distressing, indeed, is war! Its ravages cause us horror. Luckless Filipinos succumb in the confusion of combat, leaving behind
them mothers, widows and children. America could put up with all the misfortunes she brings on us without discomfort; but
what the North American people are not agreeable to is that she should continue sacrificing her sons, causing distress and
anguish to mothers, widows and daughters to satisfy the whim of maintaining a war in contravention of their honourable traditions
as enunciated by Washington and Jefferson.

</p>
<p id="d0e817">Go back, therefore, North American people, to your old-time liberty. Put your hand on your heart and tell me: Would it be
pleasant for you if, in the course of time, North America should find herself in the pitiful plight, of a weak and oppressed
people and the Philippines, a free and powerful nation, then at war with your oppressors, asked for your aid promising to
deliver you from such a weighty yoke, and after defeating her enemy with your aid she set about subjugating you, refusing
the promised liberation?
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e819"></a>Page 59</span></p>
<p id="d0e820">Civilized nations! Honourable inhabitants of the United States, to whose high and estimable consideration I submit this unpretentious
work, herein you have the providential facts which led to the unjust attack upon the existence of the Philippine Republic
and the existence of those for whom, though unworthy, God made me the principal guardian.

</p>
<p id="d0e822">The veracity of these facts rests upon my word as President of this Republic and on the honour of the whole population of
eight million souls, who, for more than three hundred years have been sacrificing the lives and wealth of their brave sons
to obtain due recognition of the natural rights of mankind&#8212;liberty and independence.

</p>
<p id="d0e824">If you will do me the honour to receive and read this work and then pass judgment impartially solemnly declaring on which
side right and justice rests, your respectful servant will be eternally grateful.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
